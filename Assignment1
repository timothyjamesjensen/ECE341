1) What are the 5 classic componenets of a computer? Provice an example (just a couple words) for any three of the components in a smartphone.

A. Datapath, Control, Input, Output, Memory

2) In a few words (less than 10), state what has been the primary reason for the rapid advances in computer technology?

A. Moore's law and the doubling of transistors every two years.

3) Given a color display using 8 bits for each of the primary colors (red, green, blue) per pixel and a frame size of 1920x1080.
	a) What is the minimum size in bytes of the frame buffer to store a frame?

	A. (24 * 1920 * 1080) / 8 = 6,220,800 bytes.

	b) How long would it take at a minimum for the frame to be sent over a 100Mbits/s network?

	A. 6,220,800 / 125,000 = 49.7664 seconds

4) Provide the binary and hexadecimal representations for the integer -27 in the following forms. Don't use a calculator! Do it by hand.
	a) Sign and magnitude as an 8 bit value
		A. 1011011
	b) 8 bit 1's complement as an 8 bit value
		A. 11100100
	c) 2's complement as an 8 bit value
		A. 11100101
	d) 2's complement as a 12 bit value
		A. 111111100101
	e) As a floating point number in the simple 16 bit form presented in class.
		A. 

5) Consider a processor with a 1.6GHz clock rate and a CPI of 1.7. If a program runs in 10 seconds:
	How many clock cycles were required?
		Work. 9411764705.8824 * 1.7 
		A. 16000000000
	How many instructions executed?
		Work. 10 = (instructions * 1.7) / 1.6x10^9
		A. 9411764705.8824

6) Consider a program that has 1 billion instructions and executes in 1.1 seconds, what is the CPI if the clock cycle time is 500 picoseconds?
	Work. 1.1 = 1,000,000,000 * CPI * 500x10^-12
	A. 2.2

7) If a better compiler than the one used in problem 6 produced a half billion instructions with an average CPI of 1.1, what would be the speedup over the original 1.1 seconds on the same processor?
	Work. time = 500,000,000 * 1.1 * 500x10^-12
	A. Twice as fast. 2x the speed. 1billion instructions would execute in .55 seconds
